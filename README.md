# Super Mario Game â€“ OOP C++ Project

This project is a C++ implementation of a **Super Mario-style game**, developed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and libraries such as **SFML** and **Box2D**. The player controls Mario, navigating platforms, collecting coins, and avoiding enemies. The game ends in **victory** (all coins collected) or **defeat** (collision with an enemy).

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Apply OOP concepts to game development.
- Create interactive gameplay using SFML and Box2D.
- Demonstrate core programming skills including:
  - Class design, inheritance, constructors/destructors.
  - File handling and I/O.
  - Game physics and animation.

## Tools & Technologies

- **C++**
- **Visual Studio** (IDE)
- **SFML** (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
- **Box2D** (Physics engine)

## Key Concepts Used

- Inheritance & Class design
- Parameterized Constructors & Destructors
- Friend classes
- File handling (`<fstream>`)
- Graphics and input management with SFML
- Gravity simulation and collision using Box2D

## Game Logic Summary

- Player moves using keyboard inputs.
- Coins are scattered across platforms â€“ collect all to win.
- Enemies move in patterns â€“ colliding with them ends the game.
- Game keeps track of collected coins and game status.
